Christopher Caviness - dayPlanner - Week 5 homework - README

1. Linked Momentjs inside the HTML at the bottom of the page. Created a variable that changes the inner text of a paragraph element to match the current time.

2. Created an initial container that holds all the time block divs (Time - Text Area - Save Button). Duplicated this to represent every hour from 9am to 5pm.

3. Created 3 variables to represent the hour, hour content, and the save button. 

4. Created a for loop that puts an event listener on the save buttons to save the previously input text field contents into local storage.

5. Created a function that will call to local storage and show any previously saved text input to the corresponding text areas. 

6. Created a for loop that will check if the number value assigned to each hour slot is equal to / less than / greater than the hour value in Momentjs, and assign new color classed based on past/present/and future times.

7. Added additional stylings to make the time larger, the text change color / weight when either past or present, and made the save buttons more interactive on hover.
